## What is it?

This is my [NixOS](http://nixos.org) system setup, both system config under `etc/nixos` and home config under `home/jakub`.

## How to use it?

You probaly don't want to use it directly but by copying certain configuration parts.

## Why use it?

Because using NixOS is one of a kind experience! It's a declarative Linux distribution built on top of the excellent `nix` package manager, offering reliable system upgrades and rollbacks (you can rollback a kernel upgrade, you know?), and reproducible system state. I love it!

## License?

Use it however you want. No credits necessary.
